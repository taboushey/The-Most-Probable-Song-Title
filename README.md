The-Most-Probable-Song-Title
============================

This program will use of a dataset containing a million song titles
and extract the song title. It will get rid of superfluous text,
punctuation, non-English characters, and convert it all to lowercase.
It will then use Bigrams to build song titles that the user starts, 
and they would be most likely to happen, for instant if you type in 
happy, the most common word after that is birthday, and so on. It 
will stop the title at 20 words if it doesn't stop before then.
